# The Buffanetes Directory Structure

By default, Buffanetes assumes that you have a directory structure that follows the
[Buffalo directory structure conventions](https://gobuffalo.io/docs/directory-structure).

You can change things around if you want, but don't do it unless you have a great reason
and know what you're doing.

Let Buffalo and Buffanetes do the heavy lifting for you!

# The `.buffanetes` Directory

Buffanetes only adds one more directory to your project. The `.buffanetes` directory
(note the dot at the beginning!) should go at the top level of your repository. It contains
all of your Buffanetes configuration files.
