# Buffanetes Documentation

Welcome to the Buffanetes documentation! This section has all kinds of how-to guides, examples
and reference material. It's currently a work in progress.

Let's get started! These documents work best if you read them in order:

1. [Buffanetes Directory Structure](./directory_structure.md)
1. [Buffanetes Configuration](./configuration.md)
1. [Command reference](./commands.md})
