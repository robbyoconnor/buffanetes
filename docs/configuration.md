# Buffanetes Configuration

Buffanetes is completely driven by its configuration files. All the configs are written
in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml). As you read before in the 
[directory structure doc](./directory_structure.md) document, all the configuration files
go under the `.buffanetes` directory.

This is a living document. It will be updated as configuration gets fleshed out.
